### 🧠 About

I’ve been building since age 13 — from custom multiplayer servers supporting **10,000+ concurrent users** to full-stack projects that quietly run in production.  
**poccha.co** is my digital home: a collection of work, experiments, and ideas that reflect my growth as a software engineer.
